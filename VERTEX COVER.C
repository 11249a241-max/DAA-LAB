AIM:implementation of algorith for bvertex cover
Algorithm 
1. Initialize a set C to be empty (this will hold our vertex cover). 
2. Mark all vertices as "not visited." 
3. Iterate through every edge (u, v) in the graph: 
4. If neither u nor v is already in the set C (both are unvisited): 
5. Add both u and v to the set C. 
6. Mark both u and v as "visited." 
7. The set C is a vertex cover that is at most twice the size of the optimal cover.
PROGRAM:
#include<stdio.h>

#define V 5

void findVertexCover(int graph[V][V]) 
{ 
    int visited[V]; // Array to represent our Cover Set 'C' 
  
    // Start with an empty set C by marking all vertices as "unmarked = 0" 
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) 
    { 
        visited[i] = 0; 
    } 
  
    // Repeat until no unmarked edges remain 
    for (int u = 0; u < V; u++) 
    { 
        for (int v = 0; v < V; v++) 
        { 
            if (graph[u][v] == 1 && !visited[u] && !visited[v]) 
            { 
                visited[u] = 1; 
                visited[v] = 1; 
            } 
        } 
    } 
  
    // Print the Cover Set
    printf("Approximate Vertex Cover: "); 
    int count = 0; 
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) 
    { 
        if (visited[i]) 
        { 
            printf("%d ", i); 
            count++; 
        } 
    } 
}  // ✅ MISSING BRACE FIXED HERE

int main() 
{ 
    int graph[V][V] = { 
        {0, 1, 0, 0, 0}, 
        {1, 0, 1, 1, 0}, 
        {0, 1, 0, 1, 1}, 
        {0, 1, 1, 0, 1}, 
        {0, 0, 1, 1, 0}
    };
